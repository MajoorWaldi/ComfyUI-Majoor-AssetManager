# Experimental Vue Implementation

This folder contains a proof-of-concept for migrating `Card.js` to a modern Vue 3 component.

## Setup (Future)
To run this in the future:
1. `npm install vue`
2. Configure Vite to build this into a JS module that ComfyUI can load.

## Files
- `Card.vue`: The modern component.
- `package.json`: Dependency definition.
